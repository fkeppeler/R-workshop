# R-workshop

This repository contains the material of the R workshop that will be held at Stephen F. Austin State University from June 26 to June 28. 

Make sure to download R and R studio before the workshop starts. 
Instructions to install R and R studio can be found in the file "Before_the_workshop".  

The workshop will be based on the notebook "R_workshop" that is available as an "html" and an "ipynb" file in this repository.
