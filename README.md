# R-workshop

This repository contains the material of the R workshop that will be held at Stephen F. Austin State University from June 26 to June 28. 

Make sure to download R and R studio before the workshop starts. 
Instructions to install R and R studio can be found in the file "Before_the_workshop".  

The workshop will be based on the notebook 
 "R_workshop" that is available as an "html" and an "ipynb" file in this repository. 
Please, feel free to download them. I suggest you download the "html" file, which can be open in any computer using the web browser of your choice.

Please, be aware that I may update the material before the workshop starts.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. My email is fkeppeler@gmail.com 

Looking forward to meeting you all,

Kind regards,

Friedrich W Keppeler
